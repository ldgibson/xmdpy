## xmdpy

xmdpy is a package that provides Xarray interfaces for molecular dynamics trajectory files to facilitate fast and easy analysis in large trajectories. It can be used to lazily load trajectory data into Xarray Datasets and can leverage Dask to perform custom analyses in a memory-sensitive and efficient manner. By using Xarray as the container for trajectories, The powerful and flexible indexing provided by Xarray also allows for complex operations on large trajectories.

This package is in early active development and will frequently have significant changes.
